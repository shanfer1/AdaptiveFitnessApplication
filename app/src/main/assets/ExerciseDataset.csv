This exercise targets the same muscles as the side plank, including the obliques, shoulders, and lateral hips, but places extra emphasis on the adductors and is more difficult than side planks on the floor. Most lifters will need to progress to this version after mastering the basic side plank or feet-elevated side plank first.",Strength,Abdominals,Cable,Begineer,,,1,Low

Both swing variations work many of the same muscles, such as the hamstrings, glutes, and core, but because the weight must travel farther in the overhead swing, it's slightly more metabolically demanding and works the upper back and shoulders more. This combo can be performed for time or reps and works especially well in circuit-style or full-body training. If you can't perform the overhead swing without lower back or shoulder pain, just perform the chest-height swing.",Strength,Abdominals,Machine,Begineer,,,1,Low

Wide-grip bench press,"The wide-grip bench press is a compound exercise targeting the chest and, to a lesser extent, the triceps. The main difference between this exercise and the standard bench press is that the hands are placed farther apart on the bar.
